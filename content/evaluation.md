## Evaluation
{:#evaluation}

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed privacy-preserving federation framework we (i) examine the robustness of the secure solid indexs, and (ii) assess the performance gains and overheads associated in terms of indexing, source selection and querying.   

### Experimental Setup

- Describe the datasets, queries, federation configuration, etc...

### Attacker Evaluation

- Devise an attacker evaluation based on the motivating use case scenario.
- Rely on [Secure Indexes](cite:cites goh2003secure)  and other papers for a formal proof that the index is secure

### Performance Evaluation

- Indexing - Overhead associated with setup of the index (i.e. normal index vs secure index)?
- Source Selection - Performance gain from the need to consult less sources (i.e. less sources to be consulted)?
- Querying - Overhead associated with access control at query time?

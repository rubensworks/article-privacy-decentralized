## Conclusions
{:#conclusions}

In this paper, we propose a framework for privacy-preserving querying within decentralised environments where distributed data sources are governed by one or more access control policies. The proposed framework, which is built around the notion of privacy-preserving summaries, serves as a basis for exploring and comparing alternative strategies for efficient querying with access control. As a first step, we discuss a possible instantiation of this framework which uses Bloom filters for creating privacy-preserving summaries over encrypted data, and highlight several open research challenges and opportunities.

In future work, we will evaluate the use of Bloom filters for privacy-preserving federated querying both in terms of performance and privacy preservation. Additionally, we will investigate how access control policies and access keys can be managed effectively and efficiently in a decentralised Web based ecosystem such as Solid.

## Conclusions
{:#conclusions}

In this paper, we introduced our vision of a high-level framework
to optimise federated querying within decentralised environments
over data that is protected by some access control policy.
For this, we introduce the use of theoretical privacy-preserving summaries.
This framework serves as a basis for future work into the areas of decentralisation, querying and access control.

To offer suggestions for future research, we discuss possible instantiations of this framework,
where we for instance discuss Bloom filters as a technique for privacy-preserving summaries.
In future work, we will investigate these Bloom filters in more depth,
and evaluate their implementation into decentralised environments in terms of performance and security.
Additionally, we will further investigate how identity management can be managed effectively and efficiently within decentralised environments.
Finally, we will implement and evaluate the performance of shape-based access control.

If we want to move more towards a truly decentralised Web,
but still want maintain our current applications that are primarily centralised,
we will need novel techniques for achieving the same levels of user-perceived performance.
Our work provides a basis for this,
where we focus on improving performance when querying over large amounts of personal decentralised data.
However, this work is merely a starting point for the creation of more concrete techniques
for optimising querying over personal data within decentralised environments.

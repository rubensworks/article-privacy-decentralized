## Introduction
{:#introduction}

The Web was originally envisaged as a free, non-discriminatory decentralised information space built upon standards and technical specifications.  Although the Web brings major benefits as an economic, educational, and collaborative space, it also serves as a means for personal information harvesting, disinformation, and political manipulation.
One potential solution to existing personal data harvesting practices is to enable individuals to take more control over who has access to their data in the form of personal data stores. One of the leading efforts in this space is [Solid](cite:cites solid), which is a decentralised Web based ecosystem that gives people more control over their data by enabling everyone to have a personal *data pod*, and by providing app developers with the infrastructure needed to develop applications that work over distributed data sources. By decoupling data from applications, individuals are afforded more control over how their personal data are processed. In such a setting, the number of pods that need to be queried could potentially become very large, for instance in the case of a large social network.

Existing research into [data aggregators](cite:cites summaries,summaries_heritage) could be used to improve query performance by reducing the number of sources that need to be consulted for any given query. However, one of the major limitations of current aggregation techniques, is the fact that they assume that all data is public, which is not realistic in many scenarios (e.g., in a social network context individuals may wish to share a limited amount of data with acquaintances and more data with friends). As such, query execution and aggregation techniques need to be extended to cater for different access policies. Concretely, data providers need to be able to associate access policies with data, and query engines need to be able to authenticate themselves to sources such that only authorised data is returned. Furthermore, since aggregators may be untrusted third-parties, there is a need for privacy-preserving aggregation techniques, such that malicious aggregators are not able to access unauthorised data, but authorised query engines are still able to exploit indexing.

In this paper, we propose a high-level framework that can be used to: (i) optimise federated querying through privacy-preserving aggregation; and (ii) enable federated querying with access control. In addition, we present an instantiation of the proposed framework, and discuss open research challenges and opportunities.

The remainder of this article is structured as follows: In [](#background) we present the necessary background and related work. In [](#use-case) we introduce a motivating use case scenario.  Following on from this our framework is introduced in [](#framework) and the challenges and opportunities of possible instantiations are presented in [](#solution). Finally we conclude the article and discuss future work in [](#conclusions).

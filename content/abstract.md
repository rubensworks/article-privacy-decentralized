## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
The Web is a ubiquitous economic, educational, and collaborative space.
However, it also serves as a haven for personal information harvesting.
Existing decentralised Web-based ecosystems, such as Solid, aim to combat personal data exploitation on the Web by enabling individuals to manage their data in the personal data store of their choice.
<!-- Need         -->
Since personal data in these decentralised ecosystems are distributed across many sources,
there is a need for techniques to support efficient privacy-preserving query execution over personal data stores.
<!-- Task         -->
<!-- Object       -->
Towards this end, in this position paper we present a framework for efficient privacy preserving federated querying, and highlight open research challenges and opportunities.
<!-- Findings     -->
<!-- Conclusion   -->
<!-- Perspectives -->
The overarching goal being to provide a means to position future research into privacy-preserving querying within decentralised environments.

## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
The Web as we know it is a ubiquitous economic, educational, and collaborative space.
However, it also serves as a haven for personal information harvesting, disinformation, and political manipulation.
Existing decentralized Web-based ecosystems, such as Solid,
aim to combat personal data exploitation on the Web by giving individuals more control over their data.
<!-- Need         -->
Since personal data in these ecosystems is distributed across many sources,
there is an urgent need for techniques support efficient privacy-preserving query execution over such personal data.
<!-- Task         -->
<!-- Object       -->
Towards this end, in this paper we present a framework that can be used
to assess the effectiveness of alternative strategies for efficient federated querying with access control.
<!-- Findings     -->
In addition, we present a theoretical instantiation of the proposed framework, and discuss open research challenges and opportunities.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
<!-- Perspectives -->
Our framework will provide a basis for positioning future research into privacy-preserving querying within decentralized environment.

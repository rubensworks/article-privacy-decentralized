## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
The Web as we know it is a ubiquitous economic, educational, and collaborative space.
However, it also serves as a haven for personal information harvesting, disinformation, and political manipulation.
Existing decentralized Web-based ecosystems, such as Solid,
aim to combat personal data exploitation on the Web by giving individuals more control over their data,
<!-- Need         -->
however there is a need for new techniques that support efficient privacy-preserving query execution over personal data that is distributed across many sources.
<!-- Task         -->
<!-- Object       -->
Towards this end, in this paper we present a framework that can be used
to assess the effectiveness of alternative strategies for efficient federated querying with access control.
<!-- Findings     -->
In addition, we present a theoretical instantiation of the proposed framework, and discuss open research challenges and opportunities.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
<!-- Perspectives -->
Our framework will provide a basis for positioning future research into privacy-preserving querying within decentralized environment.

The Web as we know it is a ubiquitous economic, educational, and collaborative space, however it also serves as a haven for personal information harvesting, disinformation, and political manipulation. Although existing decentralized Web-based ecosystems, such as solid, aim to combat personal data exploitation on the web by giving individuals more control over their data, effective privacy-preserving indexing and access control techniques are needed in order to make such platforms practically viable. Towards this end, in this position paper we present a framework that can be used to assess the effectiveness of alternative authentication, access control, and  privacy-preserving indexing strategies. In addition, we present an instantiation of the proposed framework, and discuss open research challenges/opportunities.
